# Bugs

# ToDo
* define classes
* create (empty) classes
* read and write data via JSON
* create UI for data-input
* create UI for data visualisation (first without qwt to understand the painter-concepts of Qt, maybe later with qwt)
* implement "algorithm" for moving average
* implement "algorithm" for weight trend indicator

# Ideas
* analog to WheightDrop-App app but with more "analysis"
* use model/view/controller
* moving average
* weight trend indicator (deep green (loosing), green (holding), yellow (slightly gaining), red (gaining constantly))
* BMI analysis

# Done
