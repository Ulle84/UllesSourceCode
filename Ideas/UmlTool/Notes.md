# ToDo

# Ideas
* very simple UML editor - only class diagrams
  * elements: class, interface
  * connection: inherit, implement, aggregate
* only define the structure, layouting is done automatically - is this possible?
* catalog (text-file) with all available classes -> can be created by ClassAnalyzer

# Done
