# Bugs

# ToDo

# Ideas
* very simple UML editor - only class diagrams
  * classifier: namespace, classname
  * elements: class, interface
  * connection: inherit, implement, aggregate
* only define the structure, layouting is done automatically - is this possible?
* catalog (text-file) with all available classes -> can be created by ClassAnalyzer
* mouse handling
  * press and move -> move elements
  * Shift+Press on element and move to another element -> draw arrow between two elements -> arrow-style is defined base on type

# Done
