# Bugs

# ToDo

# Ideas
* Use Model/View Classes of Qt - QTreeView for example
* Tree of Tasks (like in ToDoList)
* Each task has a set of attributes
* Different task-types with different attributes?
* Archive: calendar view of done tasks
* Time tracking
* Comments in Mark-Down Format - two tabs: edit and view
* difficulty level for tasks - do the hard work in the morning, when the mind is fresh, do the easy ones after the lunch-break, when the mind is tired
  * very difficult (create new concept, for example)
  * difficult (implement a given algorithm, for example)
  * moderate (gathering information, for example)
  * easy (, for example)
  * very easy (repeated action - filling in Stundenzettel, for example)
