# Ideas
* two modes
  * existing files: do moderate cleaning -> indentation

* option-file -> use option file of AStyle and extend it
* two modes: gui and console

* sort includes (in blocks and alphabetically)
  * std includes
  * Qt includes
  * own includes
* Intializer list - SimpleWaitCondition() : _ready(false) -> : and , at end of line, not in beginning
