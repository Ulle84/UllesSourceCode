# Bugs

# ToDo (prioritised)
* implement template Matrix
* implement move-constructor and move-operator -> copy from cImage and remove afterwards -> test, that the move-constructor and move-operator are called, when possible
* ImageGray
  * create class ImageGray which inherits from Matrix<unsigned char> -> test that move-constructor and move-operator of Matrix is used
  * implement a converter to QImage
* ImageRGB -> analog to ImageGray -> QImage::Format_RGB32 and QImage::Format_ARGB32
* return reference to image at functions which change the image content, i. e. erode dialte etc.
  * test that move-constructor and move-operator are used, otherwise this operations will be very "expensive"
  * test: imageEroded = image.erode(blub);
  * test: image = image.erode(blub);

# Ideas
* rectangle with orientation-angle
* drawEllipse - circle is also an ellipse
* polygon data type + drawFunction (polygon is a closed polyline) -> for filled polygons: SaatfÃ¼l-Algorithmus
* interactive teachIn
  * circle
  * line
  * rectangle
  * polygon
* add type region -> bit-mask for mopholgical operations -> instance of Matrix<bool>
* crop image
* add noise to image
* look into Burger/Burge and implement some algorithms
* test openCV, generate converter for openCV
* contour tracing with pavlidis -> https://github.com/UnilVision/visionbase/blob/master/binary/contour%20tracing/Pavlidis/Pavlidis/pavlidis.c
* read from file
* write to file
* run length code
* rotate image with defined angle
* labeling
* blob analysis
* ImageManager: holds references to Images - display has a reference to ImageManager
* 16 bit images -> ImageViewer has a range-slider, where the displayed bits can be selected
* datamatrix code
  * create
  * read generated
  * test: change some pixels and try to read

# Documentation
* vector of mixed types is not possible, so a vector of a template with different initialisations is also not possible -> Image with different Layers (int, double, bool) is currently not possible
* Best approach of some hours of testing: Base Template Class (3d)Matrix + Derivations (ImageGray, ImageRGB, etc)
* Matrix is template base class, all algorithms which are type-independent are defined here
