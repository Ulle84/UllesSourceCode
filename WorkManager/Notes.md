# Ideas
* Use Model/View Classes of Qt - QTreeView for example
* Tree of Tasks (like in ToDoList)
* Each task has a set of attributes
* Different task-types with different attributes?
* Archive: calendar view of done tasks
* Time tracking
* Comments in Mark-Down Format - two tabs: edit and view

# Done
